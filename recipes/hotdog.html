    <h1>Hotdog</h1>
    <img src="hotdog.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hotdog is a popular and widely recognized food item consisting <br>of a cooked sausage served in a sliced bun or roll. <br>It is a quintessential part of American cuisine and has become<br> popular in various forms across the globe.<br>

        The sausage used in a hotdog is typically made from <br>a blend of finely ground meat, such as beef, pork, <br>chicken, or a combination thereof. The meat is seasoned<br> with various spices, including salt, pepper, garlic,<br> paprika, and other flavorings. The seasoned meat mixture <br>is then stuffed into a casing, which can be natural or <br>synthetic, giving the sausage its characteristic <br>cylindrical shape.<br>
        
        Hotdog sausages are often pre-cooked or smoked, <br>which means they are safe to eat without further cooking.<br> However, they are commonly grilled, boiled, steamed,<br> or heated on a griddle to enhance their flavor and texture.</p>

        <h1>Steps for making hotdog</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the necessary ingredients, including sausages,<br> buns, and your preferred toppings and condiments.</li>
            <li>If your sausages are raw or uncooked, cook them according <br>to the package instructions. This can typically be<br> done by grilling, boiling, steaming, or pan-frying<br> the sausages until they are heated through and have <br>reached a safe internal temperature.</li>
            <li>While the sausages are cooking, prepare the buns by slicing<br> them open lengthwise, creating a space for the sausage.</li>
            <li>Once the sausages are cooked, remove them from the heat source<br> and let them rest for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Take a cooked sausage and place it inside the sliced bun. <br>The sausage should fit snugly.</li>
            <li>Add your desired toppings and condiments onto the sausage.<br> This can include mustard, ketchup, relish, onions, <br>sauerkraut, cheese, or any other toppings you enjoy.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process for the remaining sausages and buns.</li>
            <li>Serve the hotdogs immediately while they are still warm. <br>You can enjoy them as a handheld snack or serve them on <br>a plate alongside some sides like French fries or potato chips.</li>
