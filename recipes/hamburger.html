    <h1>Hamburger</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A hamburger, often simply referred to as a burger, <br>is a popular and iconic food item that consists of a cooked<br> ground meat patty served between two sliced buns. <br>It is a staple in fast food chains, restaurants, and backyard<br> barbecues worldwide.<br>

        The key component of a hamburger is the patty, <br>which is typically made from ground beef. However, <br>variations of burgers can feature other meats like chicken,<br> turkey, pork, or even vegetarian or vegan options <br>made with plant-based proteins.<br> The ground meat is seasoned with various ingredients<br> such as salt, pepper, and other spices to enhance its flavor.<br>
        
        The patty is typically cooked by grilling, <br>pan-frying, or broiling until it reaches the desired level<br> of doneness, which can range from well-done to medium or<br> medium-rare, depending on personal preference. </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef (usually lean or medium-fat)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Optional additional seasonings (such as garlic<br> powder, onion powder, or Worcestershire sauce)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps for making Hamburger</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the necessary ingredients, including ground beef, <br>buns, toppings, and condiments.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill, stovetop pan, or barbecue to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Take the ground beef and season it with salt, pepper, <br>and any additional desired seasonings. Mix the seasonings <br>into the meat gently, being careful not to overwork the mixture.</li>
            <li>Divide the seasoned ground beef into equal portions, <br>typically around 1/4 to 1/3 pound (113 to 150 grams) per patty.<br> Shape each portion into a round patty, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch <br>(1.3 to 1.9 cm) thick. Make a slight indentation in <br>the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing<br> up during cooking.</li>
            <li>Place the hamburger patties onto the preheated grill,<br> pan, or barbecue. Cook for approximately 4-5 minutes on each side,<br> or until the internal temperature reaches at least 160°F <br>(71°C) for medium doneness. Adjust the cooking time <br>based on your desired level of doneness.</li>
        </ol>
